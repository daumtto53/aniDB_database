Mozaiku no Sakana,"This is the story of a college student named Akiko. She has just moved out on her own for the first time, and has just moved to Tokyo. She moves into her new apartment, and, for the first time, faces life away from her parents. Things are not quite as fun as you’d imagine. She has never slept in an apartment all alone, and it makes her nervous. Fortunately she has a neighbor to run to in times of stress. His name is Fuji-san, and he lives in the apartment right next to Akiko. This poor guy was enlisted by Akiko to lift all her heavy boxes up the stairs to her new place. He was a rather unwilling helper, but Akiko was desperate and pleaded with him, and he couldn’t turn her down. Now Akiko is all alone in her apartment, and facing lonliness, bugs, and an unwillingness to unpack all her boxes. Through all of this, Fuji-san sees Akiko terrified of bugs, drunk on sake, and running around with her boyfriend. Being neighbors, Akiko visits Fuji-san a lot, and they have many conversations and learn a lot about each other. The first chapter is seen through Akiko’s eyes, and the second chapter is mainly form Fuji’s point of view. I really like how their relationship develops. To Fuji-san, Akiko is cute, a bit wild, and more experienced than he. He is quiet, kindof surly, and very practical. She has lots of friends and a boyfriend. Fuji-san has a girlfriend, but she lives far away, and he keeps in contact with her via email.

Damekko Doubutsu,"Adapted from Wikipedia and Myanimelist.net:Background: Damekko Doubutsu features characters that wear kigurumi (mascot/animal character) costumes and who seem to be either living as or putting on a play about animal outcasts who must live in the ""Useless"" Forest due to behaving strangely for their species. For example, the main character, Uruno, is a wolf who has the personality of a shy rabbit; meanwhile, Usahara, a rabbit, acts like a wolf.Story: Uruno, the shy wolf, is on the road searching for a new place to call home. He soon comes upon a whole forest full of ""useless animals"": that is, animals that don't live up to their species' usual character. After a short fight with the smoking, bad-tempered rabbit, Usahara, Uruno decides that he wants to move on... but changes his mind upon meeting Chiiko, a clumsy cheetah girl. It's love at first sight for Uruno, and after deciding to stay for her, he continues to hope that even though he's a good-for-nothing, he'll win her over someday. That is, if living with the other strange residents of the forest— including the aformentioned smoking rabbit, a sake-drinking unicorn, a near-sighted eagle, an orca that cannot swim, and a shy pegasus—doesn't get to him first.See also:http://animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4994Official Kids Station site for the anime (in Japanese)",Manga,2001,[],"[{'title': 'Damekko Doubutsu', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'Animals Who Are the Children of Hopelessness', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'Damekko Doubutu', 'language': 'id'}, {'title': ""Li'l No-Good Animals"", 'language': 'et'}, {'title': ""Li'l No-Good Animals Exiled from the Mulberry Grove Stuffed-Animal Costume Theatre"", 'language': 'en'}, {'title': ""Mulberry Grove's Stuffed-Animal Costume Theatre's Li'l No-Good Animals"", 'language': 'en'}, {'title': ""Mulberry Plantation's Cartoon-Character Costume Theater's Useless Animals"", 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'Souden Kigurumi Gekijou Damekko Doubutsu', 'language': 'fi'}, {'title': 'These Animals Are Not Allowed', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'Useless Animals', 'language': 'et'}, {'title': 'Useless Animals from the Mulberry Tree Plantation Cartoon-Character Costume Theater', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'だめっこどうぶつ', 'language': 'ja'}, {'title': '桑田着ぐるみ劇場だめっこどうぶつ', 'language': 'ja'}]","{'volume': 11, 'status': 'Ongoing'}",https://cdn.mangaupdates.com/image/i142650.jpg,['KUWATA Noriko'],['KUWATA Noriko'],"[{'publisher': 'Takeshobo', 'label': ''}]","[{'publisher': 'Takeshobo', 'label': 'Manga Life'}]","['Comedy', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']",[]

A drawing contest is held for the city's citizens. If he wins, he will receive 10,000 francs and the chance to study at an art school in Paris. At first, Mash gives up because he has no oil paints, brushes or other art supplies. However, with the help of his childhood friend, Sophie, he is able to acquire the tools he needs to deal with the problems that arise in his daily life.  Just when he thinks he is on track to meet the deadline, his father, Voss, who is against him becoming a painter, tears up his paintings and throws them away.

But underneath the sheen of perfection lurks a secret with the power to shake the world to its foundations. During a boyhood excursion to one of the southern archipelagos near Okinawa, Yuki barely survived exposure to a poison gas stored at a foreign military facility. The leakage annihilated all of the island’s inhabitants but was promptly covered up by the authorities, leaving Yuki as an unacknowledged witness—one whose sense of right and wrong, however, the potent nerve agent managed to obliterate.Now, fifteen years later, Yuki is a social climber of Balzacian proportions, infiltrating the worlds of finance and politics by day while brutally murdering children and women by night—perversely using his Kabuki-honed skills as a female impersonator to pass himself off as the women he’s killed. His drive, however, will not be satiated with a promotion here and a rape there. Michio Yuki has a far more ominous objective: obtaining MW, the ultimate weapon that spared his life but robbed him of all conscience.There are only two men with any hope of stopping him: one, a brilliant public prosecutor who struggles to build a case against the psychopath; the other, a tormented Catholic priest, Iwao Garai, who shares Yuki’ls past—and frequently his bed.",Manga,1976,"[{'title': 'Tezuka Gakuen', 'type': 'Manga', 'relation': 'Alternate Story'}]",[],"{'volume': 2, 'status': '1995, Bunko'}",https://cdn.mangaupdates.com/image/i444240.jpg,['TEZUKA Osamu'],['TEZUKA Osamu'],"[{'publisher': 'Kodansha', 'label': '1993'}, {'publisher': 'Shogakukan', 'label': '1978, 1981, 1989, 1995'}]","[{'publisher': 'Shogakukan', 'label': 'Big Comic'}]","['Horror', 'Mature', 'Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Romance', 'Seinen', 'Shounen Ai', 'Slice of Life', 'Tragedy']",[]
