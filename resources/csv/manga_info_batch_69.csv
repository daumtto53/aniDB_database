The Swamp,"From Drawn & Quarterly:Yoshiharu Tsuge is one of the most influential and acclaimed practitioners of literary comics in Japan.

These mesmerizing comics, like those of his contemporary Yoshihiro Tatsumi, reveal a gritty, at times desperate postwar Japan, while displaying Tsuge’s unique sense of humor and point of view.“Chirpy” is a simple domestic drama about expectations, fidelity, and escape. A couple purchase a beautiful white bird with a red beak. It is said that the bird will grow attached to its owners and never fly away. While the girlfriend is working as a hostess, flirting with men for money, the boyfriend decides to draw a portrait of the new family member, and disaster strikes.In “The Swamp,” a simple rural encounter is charged with sexual tension that is alluring but also fraught with danger. When a young woman happens upon a wing-shot goose, she tries to calm it then suddenly snaps its neck.

Thomas no Shinzou,"The setting: A boys' boarding school in Germany, sometime in the mid-20th century. One winter day, fourteen-year-old Thomas Werner falls from a lonely pedestrian overpass to his death, immediately after mailing a single, brief letter to another boy at the school:To Juli, one last time.This is my love.This is the sound of my heart.Surely you must understand.Thus begins Moto Hagio's The Heart of Thomas – one of the most compelling and enigmatic manga graphic novels ever created, and a pioneer in the popular boys'-romance ""shounen-ai"" genre. Thomas's death (was it an accident? suicide? or even murder?) immediately throws the school into turmoil, while his letter sets off a chain of emotional upheaval both for the recipient and an even-expanding circle of friends, family, and teachers, as secrets are revealed and shared. And then a new boy who looks exactly like Thomas shows up at the school...Unabashedly romantic and emotionally complex, The Heart of Thomas features an unusual, richly imagined setting and a cast of memorable characters.(Source: Fantagraphics)Featured in volumes 11 and 12 of the Hagio Moto Works:1.

Tide-Line Blue,"The catastrophe, ""Hammer of Eden,"" resulted in the loss of six billion lives and the flooding of 90% of the land. The New United Nations were formed to pursue peace on the ruined lands 14 years later. Keel is a boy living in a town called Yabitsu, an area which prospered due to the energy from the nuclear generator brought by the catastrophe. His next kin, Aoi, is the secretary general of the New United Nations. She views the catastrophe as an opportunity to create a new world in which nations can help one another overcome differences in races and religions. However, her efforts to realize that vision fail because of the unwillingness of the nations to change. Gould, a military officer, feels that the only way to make an order is through the military. Using Ulysses, a nuclear submarine, along with his crew, including Keel's brother Tean, Gould carries out a coup to declare war against the New United Nations in his attack on Yabitsu.(Source: ANN)",Manga,2005,[],"[{'title': 'Tide-Line Blue', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'タイドライン・ブルー', 'language': 'ja'}]","{'volume': 1, 'status': 'Discontinued?'}",https://cdn.mangaupdates.com/image/i36967.jpg,['RENBO Yoshie'],"['IIDA Umanosuke', 'OZAWA Satoru']","[{'publisher': 'Akita Shoten', 'label': ''}]","[{'publisher': 'Akita Shoten', 'label': 'Champion Red'}]","['Action', 'Sci-fi', 'Shounen']",[]

비밀,"It's the 2060's, and Japan has perfected ""The MRI System,"" a piece of neurotechnology that, when given the brain of a person who died within the past 48 hours, can analyze the visual memories contained within; even being able to give scientists a look into what the deceased saw in their final moments. Needless to say, this is a highly regarded - and greatly feared - method that has been placed under stringent restrictions and is only authorized for use by a special police unit, Section Nine, for the investigation of baffling or high-profile crimes. Aoki Ikkou is a talented newbie who has just been assigned to Section Nine. He initially has qualms about delving into people's most private moments and analyzing their darkest fears and fantasies, but as he settles in with his teammates and warms up to his boss, the highly intelligent Maki Tsuyoshi, he becomes more and more competent at his job. Though quick to develop pride in his career, Aoki still struggles to balance his family relationships and love life with his demanding workload, further complicated when he's drawn into the dark past and murky circumstances surrounding the outwardly cool and self-controlled but internally tormented Maki.The first chapter is a prologue that features the first case where the MRI method was used.
