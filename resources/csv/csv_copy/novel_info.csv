"""Bungaku Shoujo""","From Yen Press:For Tohko Amano, a third-year high-school student and self-styled “book girl,” being the head of the literary club is more than just an extracurricular activity. It’s her bread and butter…literally! Tohko is actually a literature-gobbling demon, who can be found at all hours of the day munching on torn-out pages from all kinds of books. But for Tohko, the real delicacies are hand-written stories. To satisfy her gourmet tastes, she’s employed (rather, browbeaten) one Konoha Inoue, who scribbles away each day after school to satisfy Tohko’s appetite. But when another student comes knocking on the literary club door for advice on writing love letters, will Tohko discover a new kind of delicacy?Main story:1. Book Girl and the Suicidal Mime2.

At that time, a huge sword flew from the heavens, piercing the sun and causing a huge sensation on Earth. Perhaps because the scabbard of the sword was already in tatters, countless shards have broken off from it following the collision with the sun and spread across the universe. Many of these shards have landed on various places across Earth. With the arrival of the bronze sword and its shards, a new unlimited energy source has suddenly appeared on Earth. This energy source has since been named Spirit Qi. Spirit Qi is like air, thick in some places and thin in others. As the Federation and other factions gather more shards, they discover more information on cultivation, pill refinement, Spirit Stone refinement, and other techniques. The words on the shards have an ancient feel to them, making it a trend for people to use ancient language. The appearance of Spirit Qi rapidly makes the original energy sources obsolete and has completely changed people's lives.

Allison,"Allison is an adventure series set in a world containing one continent (extending roughly from the Equator to 60 degrees North latitude) which is divided down the center by a towering mountain range and a huge river. The industry and technology of the world are roughly equivalent to Europe in the 1930s. Due to the geography, two cultures developed on either side of the divide, and at the time the story begins, the cultures have been at war on and off for hundreds of years. The bloodiest conflict yet began thirty-five years before the start of the story; both sides are so exhausted by the conflict that an uneasy armistice is signed after some five years of fighting. Aside from a brief conflict over the jurisdiction of the river, resulting in the formation of a buffer zone on either side, this peace has largely been unbroken. The east side of the world is known as Roxche, though formally the region's name is the Roxcheanuk Confederation. The entire region comprises sixteen countries which all speak a common language. The west side is known as Sou Beil, though formally the region's name is the Allied Kingdoms of Bezel Iltoa. The region comprises the two kingdoms of Bezel and Iltoa which both serve to bring together a small number of countries under a common language different than that of the eastern region. There are far more blond-haired people in the West than the East.At the beginning of the first novel, Allison, a pilot in the Roxche Air Force, has come to visit her childhood friend Wilhelm (""Wil"" for short), who has remained at school over his summer break to continue his studies. While traveling in the countryside near the school, the two encounter an old man well-known to Wil's schoolmates as a teller of tall tales. Nevertheless, he captures their interest with his talk about a ""treasure"" which, if found, is said to be able to put an end to the war. No one would believe him that the war between the countries could ever end, so no one listened to him. When the old man is abducted and taken over to Sou Beil, Allison and Wil steal an airplane and chase the abductors across the river into the next region. Fortunately, the two were raised as orphans by a woman who came from the West, and thus can speak both languages.","[{'publisher': 'MediaWorks', 'label': 'Dengeki Bunko Magazine'}]",2002,"[{'title': 'Allison', 'type': 'Manga', 'relation': 'Spin-Off'}, {'title': 'Lillia to Treize', 'type': 'Novel', 'relation': 'Sequel'}]","[{'title': 'Allison', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'Аллисон', 'language': 'ru'}, {'title': 'アリソン', 'language': 'ja'}]","{'volume': 4, 'status': 'Complete'}",https://cdn.mangaupdates.com/image/i176134.png,['KUROBOSHI Kohaku'],['SHIGUSAWA Keiichi'],"[{'publisher': 'MediaWorks', 'label': ''}]","[{'publisher': 'MediaWorks', 'label': 'Dengeki Bunko Magazine'}]","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen']",[]

Immortal of the Ages,"As Yun Xiao's soul soared into the heavens after his death, he made a startling discovery—the vast world in which he had lived for sixteen years astonishingly resembled a colossal tomb! Beneath it lay an ancient bronze coffin, vast as the boundless seas, radiating an overwhelming miasma. Every piece of land was but a handful of dirt atop this enormous coffin. The billions of living souls unknowingly thrived and multiplied within this graveyard soil.Inside the massive casket rested the body of an Immortal. His eyes were as deep as the underworld, his mouth reminiscent of the Yellow Springs, his hair flowed like a majestic dragon, and his body spanned across a million mountain ranges. Which celestial deity from ancient times could be resting here for eternity?Refusing to let himself fade away, Yun Xiao's soul entered the body of the Immortal. With the world's Divine Pillar as his sword and the vast continents as his seals, he and the coffin embark on a journey through the Immortal path, seeking enlightenment and challenging the heavens!Translator's Notes: The novel is a slow burn. It might start out as your bog-standard revenge-plot, reincarnation story. But the execution is solid, and there's plenty of satisfying face-slapping moments throughout. What makes it unique is that the author eventually starts turning well-established tropes of this genre on their head and subverting expectations in really interesting ways you'd never expect. So, if you're a long time reader of the community, and want to try something familiar with a refreshing twist, give this story a shot!Original NovelOfficial English Translation",[],2022,[],"[{'title': 'Immortal of the Ages', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': '太古第一仙', 'language': 'ko'}]","{'volume': 0, 'status': ''}",https://cdn.mangaupdates.com/image/i433753.jpg,[],['Feng Qingyang'],"[{'publisher': '17k', 'label': ''}]",[],"['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Martial Arts', 'Mature', 'Seinen']",[]

투명드래곤,"An invisible dragon kills everything. [A super duper story about a super duper dragon.]Original Web Novel (copied version)Translator's review: This is perhaps one of the most famous webnovels out there in Korea for being so bad. It’s marked as the representative of the seven forbidden texts (Invisible Dragon (투명드래곤), Beautiful Angel (아름다운 천사), Blood Martial God (혈무신), Supreme Martial Arts (절세무공), Dissecting Fantasy Plots (판타지를 해체하라), Harry and Monster (해리와 몬스터), Otherworld Dragon (이세계 드래곤)). And although it's not on the list, there's an opinion that My Boyfriend's IQ is 600 (내 남자친구는 아이큐 600) should also be included in the ban. A fan animation (gif) and a fan cartoon of this work has been created.Anyway, there are a lot of theories on who the author of this novel is. Based on the terrible grammar/spelling, some say it was written by an elementary schooler. But then the novel is bad. So bad, in fact, a lot of people couldn’t believe it was written by an elementary schooler. that’s why some people assume that it was written by an author who wanted to criticize the novel world for how many of the novels were becoming extremely cliché.Right, speaking of cliché, this is probably the most generic thing you’re going to find anywhere. It literally has everything. An MC who beats up everything, trains, goes to another universe, beats everything up again, etc etc. He’s a peerless beauty as well (super bishie!!). Because of it’s nature, Korea’s renowned fantasy author, Lee Young-do (wrote Esoril’s Dragon, A Bird That Drinks Tears (Novel)), praised it for criticizing many of the novels in Korea for being so generic.","[{'publisher': 'Joara', 'label': 'Joara'}]",2002,[],"[{'title': 'Invisible Dragon', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'Crystal Dragon', 'language': 'cy'}, {'title': 'Dragón invisible', 'language': 'ca'}, {'title': 'RỒNG VÔ HÌNH', 'language': 'vi'}, {'title': 'Tumyeong Deuraegon', 'language': 'tl'}, {'title': 'Tumyeongdeuraegon', 'language': 'cy'}, {'title': 'Невидимый дракон', 'language': 'ru'}, {'title': 'التنين الخفي', 'language': 'ar'}, {'title': '透明 Dragon', 'language': 'tl'}, {'title': '투명 드래곤', 'language': 'ko'}, {'title': '투명드래곤', 'language': 'ko'}]","{'volume': 0, 'status': ''}",https://cdn.mangaupdates.com/image/i246687.gif,[],['Duichidak'],"[{'publisher': 'Joara', 'label': ''}]","[{'publisher': 'Joara', 'label': 'Joara'}]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Martial Arts', 'Sci-fi', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural', 'Tragedy']",[]

Kantai Collection - Kankore - Kankore RPG Replay - Negai wa Umi wo Koete,"Welcome to the world of Kancolle RPG! This book tells a story about a novice admiral and his interesting kanmusu (ship girls). But, this book is a little different from a normal story. This book, tells a ""Roleplaying"" story.""Roleplaying"", is a type of game that you play with other people where you read lines from the book as if you’re the one in the story. There are a lot of ""Roleplaying"" types and this book is specifically a ""Table talk"" RPG. Read it as if you’re playing kantai collection- Kancole- Kancolle RPG.This Kancolle RPG is based on a browser game called Kantai Collection. The game itself puts the player in control of girls that have the memories and powers of warships in the past. The player then must battle a mysterious threat called the ""Abyssal Fleet"" sighted all around the world. The difference between Kancolle RPG and the browser game, is that you’ll need to use dices, pieces, and follow the rules and scenarios stated by the Kancolle RPG rulebook. Obtaining ship girlsare different too; each player will only get one shipgirl. In table talk RPG, you can ease your mind, the rage, the salt that naturally comes while playing, by gathering friends who have the same hobby, and discuss while playing.Sometimes you’ll need to face the enemy seriously. Sometimes, you can put yourself in the ship girls’ shoes, and act out their lines. Sometimes you’ll have to go back to yourself, and joke at other character’s line. You playing it happily with your friends are what ""Roleplaying"" is all about.A Battleship girl who has just come back from another country, she is generous and having a big heart, Kongou.A Heavy Cruiser princess with a lack of common sense, Kumano.An eccentric Light Aircraft Carrier, Zuiho.The serious and analytical Light Cruiser, Kiso.These are the main girls who play a big part in this book. But, due to the haphazard nature of this game, you won’t be able to play their characters perfectly. Even if you try to, but deep inside, the girls you know are different. Nevertheless, we hope you would be able to enjoy that character gap.And lastly, we’ll introduce another one of the main characters, Teitoku( the Admiral). He is a young and by-the-book admiral. This novice Admiral is often being played around by the 4 wild girls. He still thinks that ""it shouldn’t be like that, it’s not like that"". This hard working Admiral is one of the view points we will be using in this book.From now, for everyone whose thinking ""I’d like to be an admiral in kancolle RPG!"" please try it.

She urgently needed someone to do some interdimensional Resource smuggling, and Renya fit the bill. His mission: cross the boundary into another world, then chill for a few decades.

Then, she mentioned the food - an exotic world comes with exotic delicacies - and this sealed the deal.The next thing he knew, he was standing in a foreign land, younger, stronger, and more clueless than ever.

Now she overheard that he only married her for appearances sake?It was just great! Not only was she forced to marry, she also lost her freedom. Since her husband was also unwilling to marry, they might as well not bother with each other…….His newly wedded wife was so very strange!A night before the wedding he caught her peeking shamelessly. She also demanded that the favor he owed her for having saved his life, two years prior in the desert was to not touch her?Usually a wife would be sharing a husband with three or four other women. Thus they would be full of worry and trepidation, serving their husband to the best of their ability attempting to become the favourite and obtain the valued Princess position. Yet she actually tried to distance herself from him as much as possible. How was this a relationship?Though it did not matter to him, for he long had the intention to separate himself from her, he was only marrying her because of the Imperial Edict after all. If he didn’t seize this golden opportunity then he was too dumb to deserve it.Let her regret it!She was very proficient in the art of Qi Huang. Even though this princess’ beauty wasn’t too outstanding, it wasn’t bad and her temperament was unquestionable. This Prime Minister’s Daughter even had a touch of feminine charisma. Her varying facial features made him forget about the other beautiful concubine completely and made him want to……..only care for her!?Although he swore to the moon that he would not touch her, however tonight the night sky was cloudy………",[],,[],"[{'title': 'Qiao Fei Gou Fu', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'The Imperial Princess Accidentally Seduced Her Husband', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': '巧妃勾夫', 'language': 'zh-cn'}]","{'volume': 0, 'status': ''}",https://cdn.mangaupdates.com/image/i288550.jpg,[],['Mo Chen'],[],[],['N/A'],[]
Pursuing Immortality,"Meet Gu Yu—a college dropout and a talented incense maker, and at the same time, the rather stoic protagonist of this story. Despite his somewhat introverted manner, he has a tendency to make sarcastic remarks in his thoughts. One day, after saving a squirrel, a windfall (metaphorically and literally) dropped into his lap. Stumbling into the cultivation world with little help, he was not turned into Superman overnight (as he would like). Apparently, becoming a cultivator would not make your life easier, at least in the beginning.Somewhere along the road, he ran into Jiang Xiaozhai, a young woman who’s got the brains, the beauty, and maybe one or two secrets of her own. As it turned out, the two made a perfect team—Mulder-and-Scully style.

They built up a school in which the children of the Illusory Perennial Domicile would come and study only survival skills. In such a small place appeared an orphan student named An Zheng who also came to study there. He was really a useless orphan in the people’s eyes due to his cowardice. They even said that he was a chicken who did not dare to do anything for himself even in fighting for himself, and no one cared about such a coward except a ten-year-old child, Du ShouShou, his only friend.

Sayonara Piano Sonata,"Naomi Hikawa is the main character of the novel, and the son of a famous music critic. Due to that, he has some musical knowledge, though it is pretty much limited to that, and perhaps the simple playing of a guitar. His hobby is to repair things, and has developed quite a good skill towards it.One day, while going to his ""secret"" scrapyard to gather some spare parts, he saw a girl playing an abandoned piano there. Somehow, the music had caused the junks to resonate, creating an illusion of a junkyard symphony. He was mesmerized by the familiar sounding melody, but he could not remember the tune. Just then, the girl noticed him, and called him a pervert/stalker. She then requested him to forget about the incident.Back at home, Naomi realized that she is the piano prodigy Mafuyu Ebisawa, who had vanished from the music scene for some unknown reason. He met her soon again, with Mafuyu as the transfer student of his class. She declared to the class that there is no need to know her too well, since she will be gone soon. She had even snatched away an abandoned music shed that he had customized for his  own personal use, in order to play her guitar. Not liking her cold personality and her sharp tongue, Naomi vowed to take back the music shed from her.Somehow, things became such that he was roped in by a senior, Kyouko Kagurazawa, and childhood friend Chiaki Aihara, to start a music band. His mission was to get Mafuyu, the required forth member, into the band. However, he soon realized the shocking truth behind Mafuyu's reason for disappearing from the piano scene and playing the guitar. Knowing that, will he be able to forget about the melody he heard from the junkyard, or will he be able to help Mafuyu play the piano again?",[],2007,"[{'title': 'Sayonara Piano Sonata', 'type': 'Manga', 'relation': 'Spin-Off'}]","[{'title': 'Sayonara Piano Sonata', 'language': 'en'}, {'title': 'さよならピアノソナタ', 'language': 'ja'}, {'title': '离别的钢琴鸣奏曲（小说）', 'language': 'zh-cn'}]","{'volume': 0, 'status': ''}",https://cdn.mangaupdates.com/image/i118010.png,['UEDA Ryo'],['SUGII Hikaru'],"[{'publisher': 'Media Works', 'label': 'Dengeki Bunko'}]",[],"['Drama', 'Romance', 'School Life', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']",[]

He felt anger instead of shocked by the words.In Xule’s mind, the stars are so blinding that no one can tolerate them. And if anyone were lighted by the stars they will become idiots.So Xule gave up his dream as a graceful naval commanders auxiliary officer, and now he begin to fall as a pool doorkeeper… He does not even know what he should follow and where he should go in this Great Age of the Spectacular.Xule, a citizen in Eastwood, came from a half-deserted star.
